In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.

Tests Cases:
Passed:a should equal 15.
Passed:b should equal 26.
Passed:c should equal 19.
Passed:You should use the += operator for each variable.
Passed:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.


Solution:


let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a += + 12;
b += 9 ;
c +=  + 7;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)


Output:

15
26
19
