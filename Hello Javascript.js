//  (Question)s One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations:

//  var camper = "James";
//  var camper = "David";
//  console.log(camper);
//  In the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James, and is then overridden to be David. The console then displays the string David.

//  In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

//  A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

//  If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:

//  let camper = "James";
//  let camper = "David";
//  The error can be seen in your browser console.

//  So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

//  Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.



let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";
